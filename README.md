# Sensemi Iris Pupil ratio determination project
Iris and pupil ratio determination (and texture analysis) 🖥️

* Iris segmentation with kmeans
  - `Kmeans` is method to find `clusters` in image
      - Here, `kmeans++` is used (from `scikit-learn`)
      - [X] Failure

* Iris detection from a face using mediapipe
       - [X] Successful

* Four corner method for pupil or iris

* Daugman's algorithm

* Hough transform

* Differential methods (sobel, prewitt etc.)
